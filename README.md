# Infinite Memory

## A web application to help memorize scripture.

I built this as an exercise in vanilla Javascript, and as a tool for use in a group where we are memorizing scripture verses.

It is straightforward: you may toggle verses on and off to highlight the cards where they are printed on the screen.

Then, by hitting the ``` Toggle Verse ``` button, a word is deleted each time you press it.

In its present version, you need to refresh the page ``` CTR/CMD+R``` in order to reload the full verse.

Also in it's present beta version, the only verses available for use are built in.
